/**
 * A string pattern defines a pattern to which you can match strings to see if
 * they share a similar pattern. Examples of string patterns are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>The pattern "Aaaaaa Aaaaaaaaaa" which is a typical firstname and lastname
 * pattern.</li>
 * <li>The pattern ".*@.*" which is a simple way to identify strings with an
 * @-sign in them (potential email).</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * A string pattern can have methods annotated with @Initialize and @Close.
 * These will be called before and after a job is executed where the given
 * string pattern is used.
 * 
 * Note: String patterns should be thread-safe!! Make sure to make sensible use
 * of synchronized blocks if there are race conditions in the string pattern
 * implementation.
