 * An {@link OutputRowCollector} is a consumer of output rows from

 * {@link Transformer#transform(org.eobjects.analyzer.data.InputRow)} method
 * automatically get's channeled to the {@link OutputRowCollector} by the

 * 
 * But some advanced {@link Transformer}s may have a need to put several rows
 * into the stream of output rows, and for this, a {@link Transformer} can
 * inject an {@link OutputRowCollector} in order to generate multiple records.
 * 
 * {@link OutputRowCollector} can be injected into {@link Transformer}s using
 * the {@link Provided} and {@link Inject} annotations.
